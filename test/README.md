Valdating catkin_pure_python
============================

This directory aims at gathering tests to validate the behavior of catkin_pure_python by :
* working with __unmodified__ state of the art python packages
* "building" them (in catkin terminology) 
* make sure we can use them (somehow)

We should also use cookiecutter to get some pure python package structure that also works in catkin.

More tests will be added when we find more use cases that fit catkin_pure_python purpose
