Valdating catkin_pip
============================

This directory aims at gathering tests to validate the behavior of catkin_pip by :
* working with __unmodified__ state of the art python packages
* "building" them (in catkin terminology) 
* make sure we can use them (somehow - run tests)

Project examples to use :
* [cookiecutter-pipproject](https://github.com/wdm0006/cookiecutter-pipproject)
* [cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal](https://github.com/kragniz/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal) 
* [cookiecutter-pypa](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)
*
* TODO : find more python package references
* TODO : add a ros package to prove it doesnt disturb normal ros process either (at least not too much...).

More tests will be added when we find more use cases that fit catkin_pip purpose
